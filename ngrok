python app.py
(Your Flask app will be running on http://localhost:5000).
5. Start ngrok
Open a new terminal window and run:

Copy code
ngrok http 5000

Enter the ngrok public URL (e.g., https://<random-id>.ngrok-free.app) in the browser's address bar.
You should now see your Flask app displayed on your mobile device.

You can now test your Flask app on your mobile device, such as logging in, enrolling students, and taking attendance.

Keep ngrok running to keep the public URL active.
If ngrok stops, the URL will no longer work. Restart ngrok for a new URL.
